# Overview

I created this project to learn more about Rust and to focus on sytax.
I also wanted to learn how to code the fibonacci sequence. 

This program asks the user to request a number in the sequence and then 
asks the user if they want to pick another number before ending the program.


{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

Tools I used:
- VS Code
- rust-analyzer extension
- CodeDDLB extenstion

I completed this project using Rust. I haven't worked with Rust before and I wanted to 
see how Rust works and learn how to use it in a VS code project

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- I want to organize my files better where both the functions are in 2 separate files
- I want to add other sequence generators
- I want to create a system that allows for the user to ask the program what the 
  last 5 numbers they requested were
